# Workshop 2.2: Setting up your DSVM

## Introduction

DSVMs are Azure Virtual Machine images, pre-installed, configured and tested with several popular tools that are commonly used for data analytics, machine learning and AI training.

In this section of the workshop, we'll learn how to:

* Sign in to your Ubuntu-based DSVM
* Configure Jupyterhub for data science work
* Install the Python packages we need for data science
* Connect to data sources
* Build and train a model

## Setup and sign in to your Ubuntu-based DSVM

Before the team can begin working on Machine Learning and Data Science tasks, everyone needs to have a development environment that will work well with common Python libraries. One of the great advantages of using a DSVM is that all the common packages required for Data Science work are already installed for you, and easily accessible via Jupyter Notebooks. 

We've commonly found the following setup to work very well:

* Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)
    * OS:  Ubuntu
    * Size:  CSP _DS12 v2_ (4 /	28.00 GiB	RAM / 56 GiB Temporary Storage)	 - optimized for memory and a medium workload
    * Region:  West Central US
    * This will also include:
      * Python 3.6
      * Jupyterhub
    * Setting up one DSVM for the whole group and logging in with Jupyterhub is best to foster collaboration and consistency
    * See [References](#references) for more guidance and help

and have provisioned one of these machines in each Resource Group. 

## Connecting via SSH or X2Go
If needed, you can connect to your DSVM's command shell using SSH, or access its GUI using X2Go.

Not every group or group member will choose to do this, but you can use the account credentials created specifically for your team. On Windows, you can download an SSH client tool like Putty. If you prefer a graphical desktop (X Windows System), you can use X11 forwarding on Putty or install the X2Go client. Mac users can connect simply using Terminal. See the [Windows](./PreReqs/vmconnect-pc.md) or [Mac](./PreReqs/vm-connect.md) documents for details. 

## JupyterHub and JupyterLab
The Ubuntu DSVM runs JupyterHub, a multi-user Jupyter server. For most team members, this will be the most convenient way to interact with the DSVM, allowing you to use a web browser from your laptop to run Data Science experiments on the server without having to install additional software on your laptop. 

To connect, browse to https://your-vm-ip:8000/ (replacing your-vm-ip with the actual IP address of the VM, which can you find in the Azure portal), enter the username and password assigned to your for the workshop, and log in. Many sample notebooks are available for you to browse and try out.

JupyterLab, the next generation of Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub, is also available. To access it, log in to JupyterHub, then browse to the URL https://your-vm-ip:8000/user/your-username/lab. You can set JupyterLab as the default notebook server by adding this line to /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py:

```python
 c.Spawner.default_url = '/lab'
```
