# luisGreeter
Use LUIS to demonstrate bot services

This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework][1].

This samples shows how to:
- Use [LUIS][2] to implement core AI capabilities
- Implement a multi-turn conversation using Dialogs
- Handle user interruptions for such things as Help or Cancel
- Prompt for and validate requests for information from the user
- Demonstrate how to handle any unexptected errors


## To run this bot
- In a terminal,
  ```bash
  cd luisGreeter
  ```
- Install modules
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Create [required services][3]
- Run the bot
  ```bash
  node ./index.js
  ```

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][4] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on running locally or  or running remotely in Microsoft Azure.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here][5]

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator v4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to `luisGreeter` folder
- Select `luisGreeter.bot` file

## Deploy this bot to Azure
See [DEPLOYMENT.md][3] to learn more about deploying this bot to Azure and using the CLI tools to build the LUIS models this bot depends on.

## Additional Resources

### Dependencies

- **[Restify][13]** Used to host the web service for the bot, and for making REST calls
- **[dotenv][14]** Used to manage environmental variables

### Project Structure
`index.js` references the bot and starts a Restify server. `bot.js` loads the main dialog router and determines how activities are processed.

### Configuring the bot

The generator created a `.env` file with the two necessary keys `botFilePath` and `botFileSecret`.  The `botFilePath` key is set to `luisGreeter.bot`.  All of the services and their respective configuration settings are stored in the .bot file.
  - For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the `botFileSecret` under application settings.
  - It is recommended that you encrypt your bot file before you commit it to your souce control system and/or before you deploy your bot to Azure or similar hosting service.  There are two ways to encrypt your `luisGreeter.bot` file.  You can use [MSBot CLI][15] to encrypt your bot file or you can use [Bot Framework Emulator **V4**][16] to encrypt your bot file.  Both options will product a `botFileSecret` for you.  You will need to remember this in order to decrypt your .bot file.

### Running the bot

```
node ./index.js
```
### Developing the bot

```
nodemon ./index.js
```
