# Workshops

## Introduction

Documentation and code to help you get up and running with the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine, Azure Databricks, and the Bot Framework.

## Optional local software
You may need to install software on your laptop in order to perform the following tasks:

1. Connecting to a DSVM from your [Windows PC](./PreReqs/vmconnect-pc.md) or [Mac](./PreReqs/vmconnect-mac.md)
2. Set up your [Windows PC or Mac](./PreReqs/bot-requirements.md) for local Bot development

Note that for most activities, you'll be able to perform Data Science on a VM and access Azure Databricks through your web broswer, so there's no need to install  software unless you know you'll be using the VM's command line or desktop.
