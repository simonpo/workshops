# Workshop 2: Data Science Hands On

## Introduction

Before the team can begin working on Data Science topics, everyone needs to have a development environment set up with approriate tools. This workshop will get you ready to begin developing, and includes hands-on experience with the following elements:

* Signing in to Azure
* Set up & use Ubuntu DSVM
* Modeling lifecycle using ML Studio and Workbench
* Model deployment
* Using Databricks cluster as a compute target
* Using PowerBI to visualize results

Take a look at these repos for additional content ideas:
